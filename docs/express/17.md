# Sessions

A session is a way to maintain stateful interactions between a client and a server over multiple requests. Since HTTP is stateless, sessions help track user activities across multiple interactions with the server.

Session Management: After successful authentication, a session is often created. This session contains information about the user's state and interactions.

Storage: Session data can be stored:

- Server-Side: The server keeps session data and uses a session ID stored on the client to retrieve it.
- Client-Side: The session data (or token) itself is stored on the client, often in cookies or local storage.

Session ID: A unique identifier that the server assigns to a session. The client stores this ID and sends it with each request to the server.

Lifetime: Sessions typically have a limited lifetime, either based on inactivity or a fixed expiration time.

## Cookie-based sessions

This is the most common method used in web applications to maintain sessions.

The session ID is stored in a cookie on the client side, and the session data is stored on the server side.

Advantages: Simple to implement and widely supported.

Disadvantages: Relies on cookies, which can be disabled or tampered with by users.

## installation

`npm i express-session@^1.18.0`

<https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session>

This is a middleware for managing sessions.

Since version 1.5.0, the cookie-parser middleware no longer needs to be used for this module to work. This module now directly reads and writes cookies on req/res. Using cookie-parser may result in issues if the secret is not the same between this module and cookie-parser.

## Regenerating a session

When you regenerate a session using req.session.regenerate, the following actions occur:

New Session ID: The server generates a new session ID and assigns it to the current user. This new session ID is different from the old one.

Preserve Session Data: Optionally, session data can be preserved and transferred to the new session. If you want to transfer specific data, you can do so manually.

Invalidate Old Session: The old session ID is invalidated. Any requests using the old session ID will be treated as a new session.

Even in the absence of specific attacks, periodically regenerating session IDs can make it harder for attackers to hijack a session, as the session ID changes regularly.

## Trusting a proxy

By setting `app.set("trust proxy", 1);`, you are telling Express to trust the first proxy in the chain of proxies that are forwarding requests to your app. This is useful if your app is behind a proxy server, like a load balancer or a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy, or a cloud provider's load balancer).

Consider an Express app running behind an Nginx server, which in turn is behind a cloud provider’s load balancer:

The client makes a request to the load balancer over HTTPS.

The load balancer forwards the request to Nginx, still over HTTPS.

Nginx forwards the request to your Express app over HTTP.

Without app.set("trust proxy", 1);, your app might see the connection as insecure and not set secure cookies correctly. Also, it might not log the correct client IP address, instead logging the IP of the Nginx server or the load balancer.

With app.set("trust proxy", 1);, Express will correctly interpret the X-Forwarded-For header to determine the client’s real IP address and trust that the connection is secure based on the proxy’s forwarding headers.
