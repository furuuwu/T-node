## body-parser vs built-in middleware

`npm i body-parser` and `npm uninstall body-parser`

body-parser is a middleware used in Express to parse the incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, making the req.body property available. It is particularly useful for handling data sent in a POST request.

In newer versions of Express, body-parser is no longer a separate dependency because Express has built-in middleware to handle JSON and URL-encoded form bodies.

    // Use built-in middleware to parse JSON bodies
    app.use(express.json());

    // Use built-in middleware to parse URL-encoded bodies
    app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

## typical flow

- Session Regeneration on Login:

    Inside the /login route, after verifying the user's credentials, req.session.regenerate is called.

    This generates a new session ID and invalidates the old one.

    The user information is then stored in the newly created session.

- Session Middleware:

    The authenticateSession middleware ensures that only authenticated users can access protected routes.

- Logout Route:

    The /logout route destroys the session, effectively logging the user out.
