# Token-based sessions

Stateless, scalable, suitable for APIs and mobile applications.

Instead of using a session ID stored in a cookie, the server issues a token (e.g., JSON Web Token) that the client stores (typically in local storage or a cookie) and sends with each request.

Advantages:

- Stateless: No need to store session data on the server.
- Scalability: Easier to scale horizontally since there's no server-side session state.
- Flexibility: Can be used for APIs and cross-origin requests.

Disadvantages:

- Token revocation can be challenging.
- Tokens can be large if they contain a lot of information.

## Other mechanisms for session management

Cookie-Based Sessions: the traditional method, simple and widely used.

Server-Side Session Storage with Headers: alternative to cookies, requires custom implementation.

- Description: Store session data on the server and use custom headers to pass the session ID instead of cookies.
- Advantages: Can work even if cookies are disabled.
- Disadvantages: Requires custom implementation and may not be compatible with all clients.

URL Query Parameters: simple but less secure.

- Description: Include the session ID in the URL query parameters for each request.
- Advantages: Simple and can work if cookies are disabled.
- Disadvantages:

    Exposes session ID in the URL, which can be logged or leaked.

    Less secure and can lead to session fixation attacks.

Web Storage (Local Storage or Session Storage): flexible storage options, requires handling security concerns like XSS.

- Description: Store the session ID or token in the browserâ€™s local storage or session storage.
- Advantages: Persistent (local storage) or temporary (session storage) storage without relying on cookies.
- Disadvantages:

    Not sent automatically with requests; needs manual handling.

    Vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks if not properly secured.

## JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

`npm i jsonwebtoken`

jsonwebtoken is the library to generate and verify JWT tokens.
