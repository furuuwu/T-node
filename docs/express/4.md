eg. JSON body:

    {
        "name": "Jo√£o",
        "age": 2,
        "isReal": true
    }

the `req.on('data', ...)` event handler collects the incoming data chunks, 
and the `req.on('end', ...)` event handler processes the complete body once all chunks have been received. 
The body is then parsed from a JSON string into a JavaScript object using `JSON.parse()`. 
This way, you can handle JSON parsing without relying on middleware.
