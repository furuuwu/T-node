# environmental variables

you run the scripts as usual (`node <file-name>.<file-extension>`) but first you need to set the environmental variables in your environmental variables file (`.env`).

You set them like this:

    USER_ID=root
    HOST=localhost
    USER_PASSWORD=password

If working on Windows, that may give you an error as there can be no special characters.

Use cat to make sure:

`cat -A .env`

The ^M characters at the end of each line in your .env file indicate that the file has Windows-style 
line endings (CRLF), which can cause issues in Unix-based environments (like the one your shell script 
is likely running in).

These ^M characters (carriage return) need to be removed, leaving only Unix-style line endings (LF).
You can use the `sed` command to remove the ^M characters:

`sed -i 's/\r$//' .env`

`cat -A .env`

However, it if you are using VSCode, in the editor you can set the "End of Line Sequence" (CRLF is the default, LF is what you want ofr .env files).

To load the .env i'm using the `dotenv` package

Another option would be to run the `run.sh` script:

`chmod +x run.sh`

`./run.sh` OR `bash run.sh`

Or simply:

`bash -x run.sh`
