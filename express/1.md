`JSON.stringify(value, replacer, space)`

Converts a JavaScript object or value to a JSON string.
    
- value: The value to convert to a JSON string.
- replacer: A function that alters the behavior of the stringification process, or an array of String and Number objects that serve as a whitelist for selecting/filtering the properties of the value object to be included in the JSON string.
- space: A String or Number that's used to insert white space into the output JSON string for readability purposes. If this is a number, it indicates the number of space characters to use as white space; this number is capped at 10.
If this is a string, its maximum length is 10; the string is used as white space. For readability, 2 is often used.

Using `JSON.stringify` with the second parameter null and third parameter 2 (for indentation) makes the output more readable.
