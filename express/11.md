If your application handles form submissions, JSON payloads, or any other request body data, you will need to use a body parser.

As of Express 4.16.0, the body parser middleware is included with Express and can be used directly without installing a separate package.

Before that, you would install a module, a popular one was `body-parser`

You would do:

    const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
    app.use(bodyParser.json());
    app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
