you run it like usual (node file-name.mjs) but first you need to set the environmental variables
in your environmental variables file (.env) you set them like this:

USER_ID=root
HOST=localhost
USER_PASSWORD=palavra-passe-mysql123!

If working on Windows, that will give you an error as there can be no special characters.
Use cat to make sure:

cat -A .env

The ^M characters at the end of each line in your .env file indicate that the file has Windows-style 
line endings (CRLF), which can cause issues in Unix-based environments (like the one your shell script 
is likely running in). 
These ^M characters (carriage return) need to be removed, leaving only Unix-style line endings (LF).
You can use the `sed` command to remove the ^M characters:

sed -i 's/\r$//' .env
cat -A .env

To load the .env i'm using the `dotenv` package
Another option would be to run the 'run.sh' script:

chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh

Or simply:

bash -x run.sh
